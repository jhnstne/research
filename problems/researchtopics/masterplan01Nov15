Java testbed: bitangents and dual space

=================================================

individual technical reports and smaller conferences on pure geometry

dual space for tangents: an alternative to the tangent hodograph
	for the representation of a plane curve's tangent space
	hodograph is many-to-one representation of lines (many points represent
	the same line: any point along the line from the origin);
	and only represents tangent vectors, not lines (i.e., is dependent
	on the original curve to define the tangent, unlike a point in
	dual space which defines a line completely);
	
computation of common tangents of curves
	(for shortest path, visibility analysis)
	
	- basic geometric tool
	- improved accuracy over polygonal models
	- Shape Modeling
	
computation of pole/polar for curves

convex hull of curves
	
computation of visibility graph of smooth curves
	(analysis of improvement over polygons)
	- CIRA01 (Alberta) or ICRA02 (Washington) are possibilities
	
computation of common tangents of curves on S3 
	- for motion amongst orientation obstacles
	- combines dual tangent space work with quaternion spline work

shortest path motion in orientation space

common tangents of surfaces
	- 3D motion
	- convex hulls of surfaces
	- true 3D lighting (a-la Teller)

=================================================

ruled surface intersection

Ruled surface intersection is best motivated as the important
CSG operation of intersection for a key class of surfaces, ruled surfaces.
Particularly important if we can show that the intersection of two surfaces
can be reduced to the intersection of ruled surfaces by finding
two ruled surfaces in the pencil of the surfaces,
motivated by the simplicity (hopefully) of ruled surface intersection.

=================================================

orientation control with quaternion splines: 
		   3) avoiding orientation obstacles
		   4) animation and robot motion

Riemannian modeling:	- curves on other surfaces
			- bipolars
			- geodesics
			- maps to surfaces
			- texture mapping
			- point and curve bisectors on surfaces
		    e.g., Voronoi diagram of points on \Sn{2} or \Sn{3}
		    (application: largest empty region of a data set on sphere,
		    which has applications in avoiding 'polluting' poles
		    of maps of spherical data, or locating a nuclear site
		    furthest from population center on a surface)

smooth contour reconstruction: 	- arbitrary topology cleanly
			 	- morphing between genus: supercontour (eyeglasses)
				- canyon saddle reconstruction (Ken)
				- plural contour reconstruction 
				- ganglion: quantum leap in sophistication

scattered data reconstruction:	- improvement of Amenta
				- use of contour techniques in scattered reconstruction
				- 3D photography
					  
subdivision surfaces:	- intersection
			- curves on subdivision surfaces

ruled surfaces:	- good user interface
		- generators and directrix curves on ruled surfaces
		- intersection
				
emptiest point on sphere
fairest ruled surface
curve-interpolating curve
inter-genus morphing

extension of visibility graph algorithm to curved environment
	- obstacles are curved
	- underlying space is curved (Riemannian)
		- pole/polar theory on surfaces
