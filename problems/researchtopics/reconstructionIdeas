Title: Modeling problems in reconstruction 

1) Given two space curves, what is the most efficient way of transforming
	one into the other and what is the associated cost?

	Direct application: edge cost for MEST
	Secondary application: morphing, model registration under motion
	
	References: Tagare (Yale), polygon difference metrics in computational
		    geometry
		    
--) Determine topology from implicit equations (H.-P. Seidel idea):
	Given three algebraic curves f1(x,y),f2,f3 on one section
	and two curves f4,f5 on another section, determine topology
	between them by forming the algebraic surface:
	(1-z)*f1*f2*f3 + z*f4*f5		    
		    
2) Given n curves in a plane, what is the best way to 
	connect them to optimally match a given parent curve?
	
	Direct application: building supercontour at a branch (bridge points)
	Secondary application: morphing n objects into one object (cross-genus
		morphing); matching (even if an object breaks up)
		
	References: curve matching (e.g., Barequet references)
	
--) Optimal triangulation between two contours: unwinding?
		
3) Given a planar hole with tangent ribbons along the boundary, 
   design a B-spline surface that fills the hole, respecting the boundary
   and tangent ribbons.
   
   	Direct application: canyon design
	Secondary application: hole design
   
   	References: hole-filling literature, quadrangulation (Touissaint)
	
4) Can a second set of contours help the reconstruction?
	What is involved in design from two sets of contours?
	
	References: Coons and Gordon surfaces.
	
5) Is error tolerance in vertical direction preserved after 
	design of horizontal direction?
	
6)a) Decimate a planar polygon while preserving planar structure.	
	But no good ideas here.

	Direct application: efficient contour reconstruction from dense scans
	Secondary application: topology-preserving data reduction

  b) Semi-automated segmentation directly into curves, rather than polygons.
