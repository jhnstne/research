given two sets of points, defining two boundaries,
find the best tube that approximates them (or just its radius)
	Requicha problem: feature definition for tolerance analysis

quickly finding bisector of complicated (~100 objects) piecewise-conic scene

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN $\alpha$-SHAPES AND MEDIAL AXIS TRANSFORM?

	$\alpha$-shape: intersection of full alpha-discs = 
			complement(union of empty circles of radius 1/alpha) =
			complement(union of maximal empty circles of rad 1/a)
	MAT: 	object = union of circles with centers on medial axis 
				and radius as defined by MAT = 
			 union of maximal inscribed circles

	similar to envelope

	
	also, distance from point to curve = radius of maximal empty
		circle centered on point
 	      bisector = locus of center of maximal empty circle 
			centered on point (similar definition to MAT)
